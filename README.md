### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is an easy to use system for storing and exchanging data.)
2. (AJAX permits client web pages to swiftly connect and exchange data with a web server, without reloading web page.)
3. (JSON allows for quick and effortless communication between servers, peers, and browser clients.)
4. (API's are sets of clearly defined methods of routines, definitions, communication protocols, and tools  that act as building blocks for the creation of software.)
5. (AJAX remains limited as requested data can be based on a third-party server that isn't supported by all web servers or browsers.)
